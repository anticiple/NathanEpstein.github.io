##What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a field at the intersection of statistics and computer science that seeks to develop algorithms which can learn from data.

Such algorithms take data as input and output a model which can be used to make predictions or decisions based on observations outside the initial data set (i.e. given a set of emails which are labelled "spam" or "not spam", we can build a model to predict whether other emails are spam).

##Types of Machine Learning

There are three major types of machine learning which employ different methods based on the available data. Those three types are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

##Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, we develop models based on labelled training data. That is, our data have both input values and output values. The goal is to develop a model that will predict correct output based on new input values. The spam detection example above is a case of supervised learning.

###Some Common Supervised Learning Techniques:

<ul>
  <li>Regression</li>
  <li>Decision Trees</li>
  <li>Random Forest</li>
  <li>k-Nearest Neighbors</li>
  <li>Neural Networks</li>
  <li>Support Vector Machines</li>
</ul>

##Unsupervised Learning

In unsupervised learning we attempt to find structure in unlabelled data. Unlike supervised learning, we do not have output values by which we can evaluate the quality of candidate solutions. Rather, we are attempting to uncover structure in the data that can be useful in understanding the system it comes from.

For example, consider a dataset consisting of red and blue images. A supervised learning algorithm might be used to 'figure out' that red and blue are different and sort those images into different groups.

###Some Common Unsupervised Learning Techniques:

<ul>
  <li>Clustering</li>
  <li>Dimensionality Reduction</li>
  <li>Hidden Markov Models</li>
</ul>

##Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is concernced with how agents should behave in order to maximize a reward function.

This is distinct from supervised learning because we are never presented with input/output pairs. The model 'learns' if a decision is good based on the outcome of a series of decisions (as opposed to an output value for a single input).

For example, in a game of chess, a player might make one mistake and not lose until 20 correct moves later. How do we determine which move was wrong? Reinforcement learning helps us answer this question.

Reinforcement learning is generally implemented as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process">Markov decision process.</a>
