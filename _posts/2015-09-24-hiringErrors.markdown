"In statistical hypothesis testing, a type I error is the incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis (a 'false positive'), while a type II error is the failure to reject a false null hypothesis (a 'false negative')."

Given the disastrous consequences of a single bad early hire, the null hypothesis in the context of hiring decisions (at a startup) should be that a candidate is not strong enough to warrant an offer. Incorrectly accepting this hypothesis, and letting a good candidate go, is bad. Incorrectly rejecting, and making a bad hire, is worse.

This turns out to be closely related to the idea, promoted by Ben Horowitz, that you should hire for strength rather than for lack of weakness. In evaluating a candidate, the basic test should be 'have I been sufficiently impressed as to reject my initial assumption?' rather than 'has the candidate avoided obvious missteps and demonstrated baseline knowledge?'. A middling candidate can pass the second test (particularly if your default mindset to is to make a hire) while they are very unlikely to pass the first.
