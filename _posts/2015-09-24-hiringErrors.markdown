"In statistical hypothesis testing, a type I error is the incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis (a 'false positive'), while a type II error is the failure to reject a false null hypothesis (a 'false negative')."

Given the <a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-hire"> disastrous consequences</a> of a single bad early hire (at a startup), the null hypothesis in the context of hiring decisions (at a startup) should be that a candidate is not strong enough to warrant an offer. Incorrectly accepting this hypothesis, and letting a good candidate go, is bad. Incorrectly rejecting, and making a bad hire, is worse.

This turns out to be closely related to the idea, <a href="http://www.bhorowitz.com/hiring_executives_if_you_ve_never_done_the_job_how_do_you_hire_somebody_good">promoted</a> by Ben Horowitz, that you should hire for strength rather than for lack of weakness. In evaluating a candidate, the basic test should be 'have I been sufficiently impressed as to reject my initial assumption?' rather than 'has the candidate avoided obvious missteps in demonstrating baseline knowledge?'. A middling candidate can pass the second test (particularly if your default mindset to is to make a hire) while they are very unlikely to pass the first.

## Practical Takeaways

1) In evaluating a candidate, you should only say yes with strong conviction. If you're unsure, the answer is probably no.

2)
**Use voting rather than discussion (at least to take the temperature) to reach a decision. **
Work on this ^

This serves to reduce the chance of making an erroneous hire. The probability of many people independently voting yes on a bad hire is lower than that of a similar consensus occurring within a persuasive voting block.

This is not to say that no discussion should happen. If initial votes are positive, it's good to reaffirm that everyone's reasoning makes sense. Alternatively, a strong candidate can have an off performance in some subset of the interview process without warranting rejection. **However, a discussion which leads to an affirmative decision on a candidate who did not receive a warm initial reaction should be viewed with suspicion.**

To use the optimization jargon, we're minimizing the probability of hiring a bad candidate subject to the constraint that we don't reject candidates that meet a certain quality bar (unanimous approval of all interviewers is a good one to shoot for but this can be relaxed if interviewers are sufficiently plentiful or hard to impress). Obviously, without such a constraint, we can guarantee we never make a bad hire by never making any hires at all.

This process has the additional benefit of keeping meetings about new hires short. Lingering hire debates can generally be cut off; if you get to an affirmative decision, you're likely to get there quickly.
